IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, it is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.</p>
           <p>As of March 2022, the database contained some 10.1 million titles (including television episodes) and 11.5 million person records. Additionally, the site had 83 million registered users. The site's message boards were disabled in February 2017.</p>
